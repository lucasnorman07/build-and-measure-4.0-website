                                If you save a project, a project shortcut will appear in the start

                                pop-up menu. The pop-up menu has options to open the project, rename
                                the project, to open the location where the project file is stored
                                and an option to delete the shortcut (please note this will not

                                y-axis goes from the top edge to the bottom edge. This means that
                                the coordinates: (0, 0) will be in the top left corner of the screen

                                A project is divided up into multiple "views" and "sheets". Views
                                are used to draw something in 1:1 scale which can then be exported
                                to a sheet view via the
                                <a href="#doc-editor-tool_bar">viewport tool</a> and then exported
                                with a frame/title block.

                                    Each view has a scale and a crop region size, which can be
                                    changed in the input boxes in the bottom of a view. The scale of
                                    a view defines which scale the view should be in when it is
                                    drawn with a viewport in a sheet view. And the crop region is
                                    the area of the view that will be visible from a viewport and
                                    cannot be moved (but you can move the objects into the crop
                                    region).

                                    has a title block and paper size, which are used to create a

                                    pressing on another tool. You can also turn off polylines in the

                            <p>
                                When drawing, moving or selecting objects, you are able to press on
                                certain "snap points" that will snap the mouse to that point. When
                                drawing a line for example, you can hover over a snap point and the
                                end of the line will snap to that point. <br />
                                There are four different snap points:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    End point - end points are <em>red</em> snap points that are on
                                    the edge of objects, like the four corners of a rectangle.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Center point - center points are <em>blue</em> snap points that
                                    are positioned between two edge points, or in the middle of an
                                    object.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    On line point - on line points are <em>green</em> snap points,
                                    that allow you snap to the closest point on for example a line.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Intersection point - intersection points, are
                                    <em>purple</em> snap points, that allow you to snap to the
                                    intersection between two objects (this doesn't work on all
                                    objects, like for example splines).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                You can also snap to specific angles when drawing and moving objects
                                by pressing the shift key to snap to 90 degrees and the alt key to
                                snap to 22.5 degrees. You could for example use this to draw a
                                completely horizontal/vertical line or a line that has a 45 degree
                                angle. This also works when moving objects, or when specifying a
                                flip angle. Shift also has some other uses like for example drawing
                                a completely squared rectangle.

                                You can also drag the mouse (with the left mouse button down) to
                                select the objects that are fully within the area that appears (it
                                checks if all of the red edge points are within that area).<br />
                                If you press the control key while clicking on an object or dragging
                                the mouse, any object that was previously selected will remain
                                selected, this allows you to select multiple objects by clicking on
                                each one while holding control.

                                The command box lets you specify precise distances when drawing and

                                representing a distance or two values representing a distance in the
                                <a href="#doc-editor-coordinate_system">x-axis</a> and
                                <a href="#doc-editor-coordinate_system">y-axis</a>

                                One cool feature that you can use with the command box is to leave
                                one section empty (a section is basically a measurement or
                                distance). You can for example type ",100cm" or "100m," (note the
                                ",") now you're still using two sections because of the "," but one
                                of the sections is empty, when a section is empty it will default to
                                the mouse position, so you could for example draw a line where the x
                                coordinate is calculated based on the number you provided in the
                                command box and the y coordinate is calculated based on the mouse
                                position.

                                <strong>How can I report bugs and suggest features?</strong> - If
                                you find an issue or want to request a feature, you can do so in the
                                report-issue and request-feature forms which you find in the navbar
                                of this website or in the bottom left corner of the desktop app.

                                <strong>Who created Build and Measure?</strong> - Build and Measure
                                was created by a single developer as a hobby project and has gone
                                through many iterations as a web app before finally landing as a
                                desktop app. You can find the old web app here:
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://buildandmeasure.netlify.app"
                                    >buildandmeasure.netlify.app</a
                                >
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Is Build and Measure free?</strong> - Yes! Build and Measure
                                is completely and utterly free and doesn't require any accounts,
                                trials and has no advertisements. This was created as a hobby
                                project and I make no money from this, in fact it even costs money
                                to pay for the domain every month, so
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://gofund.me/324017cd">donations</a>
                                are very welcome indeed.

                                - I have not paid for a code signing certificate for this app since
                                it costs a lot of money and I am offering this for free, so there
                                will be security warnings when downloading this app and it will
                                therefore also not be available on MacOS.

                                <strong>What file formats can I export to?</strong> - You can
                                currently export projects as either SVG or PDF but I might add more
                                options in the future.
