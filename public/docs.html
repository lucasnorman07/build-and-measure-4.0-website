                                and an option to delete the shortcut (please note this will not

                                y-axis goes from the top edge to the bottom edge. This means that
                                the coordinates: (0, 0) will be in the top left corner of the screen

                                    The "save as" button lets you save a copy of the project in a

                                                size, but does not gaurantee that the fonts will be
                                                displayed correctly

                                                the export, which gaurantees the correct fonts, but
                                                takes up a lot of space (makes the file bigger)

                                    First is the view-dropdown button, which is followed with a
                                    button to create a new view (has a plus icon). The dropdown
                                    button shows a list of the "views" that exist in the project.
                                    Press one of the views to switch to it, or press the delete
                                    button to remove it. Following the view-dropdown is the
                                    sheet-dropdown which works in the same way, although for the
                                    "sheets". The last button shows the currently active view/sheet.
                                    You can rename a view/sheet either by pressing that last button,
                                    or by pressing the active view/sheet in the dropdown lists.

                                A project is divided up into multiple "views" and "sheets". Both
                                function as a way to structure projects by dividing them up into
                                different logical "tabs", although they have slightly different use
                                cases. Views are generally used to create drawings of stuff in 1:1
                                scale, while sheets are used for creating exports with different
                                papper sizes and title blocks. Views can be used to for example
                                create drawings of a house, room layout or some icon, while sheets
                                allow you to insert "viewports" (using the viewport tool) of
                                different views and specify different types of papper sizes for
                                exporting (usefull for PDF). Sheets can also be usefull when
                                creating posters for printing on papper.

                                <p>
                                    Each view has a scale and a crop region size, which can be
                                    changed in the input boxes in the bottom of the editor. The
                                    scale of a view defines which scale the view should be in when
                                    it is drawn with a viewport in a sheet view. And the crop region
                                    is the area of the view that will be visible from a viewport.
                                    The crop region visibility can be toggled using the checkbox in
                                    the bottom left corner of the editor (to the right of the view
                                    scale input), and it can be resized with the width/height input
                                    boxes to the right of that. Next to those inputs are two more
                                    buttons. The first button selects the objects that are partially
                                    inside of the crop region. The one to the right of that is used
                                    for moving (fitting) the crop region to the selected objects.

                                    The line and spline objects are polylines meaning that they
                                    don't stop drawing until you escape by either pressing the
                                    escape key, right-clicking or by pressing on another tool. You
                                    can also turn off polylines in the
                                    <a href="#doc-editor-settings_menu">settings menu</a>, then they
                                    will have a click count of 2.<br />
                                    To quickly toggle the polyline setting you can also use the
                                    shortcut "p".

                                When drawing, moving or selecting objects, you are able to press on
                                certain "snap points" that will snap the mouse to that point. When
                                drawing a line for example, you can hover over a snap point and the
                                end of the line will snap to that point. <br />
                                There are five different snap points:

                                    End point - end points are <em>red</em> snap points that are on
                                    the edge of objects, like the four corners of a rectangle.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Center point - center points are <em>blue</em> snap points that
                                    are positioned between two edge points, or in the middle of an
                                    object.
                                </li>

                                    Edge point - Edge points are <em>green</em> snap points, that
                                    allow you snap to the closest point on for example a line or the
                                    edge of a circle.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Intersection point - intersection points, are
                                    <em>purple</em> snap points, that allow you to snap to the
                                    intersection between two objects (this doesn't work on all
                                    objects, like for example splines).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Canvas point - canvas points, are
                                    <em>orange</em> snap points, that allow you to snap to the grid
                                    which you can toggle in the
                                    <a href="#doc-editor-settings_menu">settings menu</a> and also
                                    the corners of the crop region in a view and the title block in
                                    a sheet.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                You can also snap to specific angles when drawing and moving objects
                                by pressing the shift key to snap to 90 degrees
                                (horizontally/vertically) and the alt key to snap to a smaller angle
                                that is specified in the
                                <a href="#doc-editor-settings_menu-angular_snap_interval"
                                    >settings menu</a
                                >, the default is 22.5 degrees. You could for example use this to
                                draw a completely horizontal/vertical line or a line that has a 45
                                degree angle. This also works when moving objects, or when
                                specifying a flip angle. Shift also has some other uses like for
                                example drawing a completely squared rectangle.

                                To select an object you need to activate the select tool which is
                                the top button in the
                                <a href="#doc-editor-tool_bar">tool-bar</a>.<br />
                                You can select an object by clicking on it or by clicking on a
                                <a href="#doc-editor-snapping">snap point</a> on that object.<br />
                                You can also drag the mouse (with the left mouse button down) to
                                select the objects that are fully within the area that appears.<br />
                                If you press the control key while clicking on an object or dragging
                                the mouse, any object that was previously selected will remain
                                selected, this allows you to select multiple objects by clicking on
                                each one while holding control. <br /><br />When an object is
                                selected, the stroke color will change to the
                                <a href="#doc-editor-settings_menu-selected_object_color"

                                to indicate that it's selected. In addition, small circles will
                                appear at the end points showing where you can snap to the object.
                                These points can also be moved by clicking on them. Furthermore,
                                small triangles will appear at the centers, which can also be
                                snapped to and moved by clicking on them.

                                The properties panel is used to change different properties on
                                objects like for example the line width, stroke color and font size.
                                When a drawing tool is selected (like the line, rectangle or circle
                                tools), it will let you specify the properties for any object that
                                is about to be drawn. When some objects are selected though, it lets
                                you change the already existing properties on those objects.
                            </p>

                                One cool feature that you can use with the command box is to leave
                                one section empty (a section is basically a measurement or
                                distance). You can for example type ",100cm" or "100m," (note the
                                ",") now you're still using two sections because of the "," but one
                                of the sections is empty, when a section is empty it will default to
                                the mouse position, so you could for example draw a line where the x
                                coordinate is calculated based on the number you provided in the
                                command box and the y coordinate is calculated based on the mouse
                                position.

                                before finally landing as a desktop app. You can find the old web

                                project and I make no money from this, in fact it even costs money
                                to pay for the domain every month, so

                                - I have not paid for a code signing certificate for this app since
                                it costs a lot of money and I am offering this for free, so there

                                <strong>What file formats can I export to?</strong> - You can
                                currently export projects as either SVG, PDF, PNG or JPG but I might
                                add more options in the future.
